# Discord Bot in JavaScript without discord.js😱
I'm way too lazy to make a readme right now

* Notes for self:
  * TODO: seperate each/most discord classes/constants/functions into its own file
  * STOP USING `globals.utils` IN UTILS BRO PLEASE
  * pretend that there isnt 9793452e+34 todo's
  * ~~im going insane~~ im going even more insane (like why do i even want 0 external deps?)
  * 70% of functions in utils folder are NOT being used at all🔥🔥🔥
  * i really want to make my own websocket util
  * this WILL have no external dependencies soon (🙏), that means no npm install 😱😱
